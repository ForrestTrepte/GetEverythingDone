# GetEverythingDone

An implementation of a task list and timer inspired by [Get Everything Done: And Still Have Time to Play](https://github.com/ForrestTrepte/GetEverythingDone.git) by Mark Forster.

Also, this is an experiment to see how well AI-generated code works. I will prompt LLMs and attempt to avoid writing any code directly.
